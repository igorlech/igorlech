### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Originally from Poland, I'm a young and eager Multimedia Design student at Business Academy Aarhus on Frontend Development specialisation. Having strong interests in this field, as well as User Experience and User Interface Design, I constantly seek for all opportunities for learning and gaining experience within these areas. I consider myself a responsible, hard-working and proactive person with a wide background in team working and communication with people.
